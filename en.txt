WublinStatueBio=This Wublin statue has been carefully crafted by its mysterious maker, down to the finest detail. Now all that's missing is the spark of life! Zap the monsters you've bred or placed on this island, and they'll transform into the electrical energy required to take up this Wublin.

DipsterBio=Timid in the light, Dipsters make their homes underground. The muffled monster music from above gives Dipsters the courage to rise and join the harmonious melody! ... although it may only be one note at a time. Dipsters are resourceful creatures, and collect natural materials to disguise the entrances to their tunnels. No one knows how far down a Dipster hole goes.

#BABY SINGLES#
Monsters/Monster_potbelly_young=Young Potbelly
Monsters/Monster_potbelly_young_bio=Playing is so much better with 2 heads! The young potbelly is a welcome addition to any strategy game, on account of their doubled brainpower. Unfortunately for the other monsterlings, Two times Zero is still Zero. 
Monsters/Monster_mammott_young=Young Mammott
Monsters/Monster_mammott_young_bio=The abominamble snowman? More like the adorable snowmons! Mammott isnt quite a boistrous master of "Bom"s but we're getting there. Meanwhile, Mammott prefers to eat food and fluff its fur. Typical. 
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_young=Young Tweedle
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_young_bio=Tweedles are well known to be airy and aloof, and the youngest members of the species are no different. When not spreading chitchat around the Floating City, these babbling birds preen themselves nonstop, hoping to be the most "fantastic feathered fling" of the day. 
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_young=Young Toe Jammer
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_young_bio=Effervescent and bubbly, tropical-demeanored Young Toe Jammers are always pleasant playmates for the other monsters. At times, situations can get a little sticky when a tossed ball finds itself lodged in the gelatinous body of this tot, but that's no match for some well executed laughter therapy.
Monsters/Monster_noggin_young=Young Noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_young_bio=Thump thump Bump bump! The newborn noggin's hands aren't quite steady enough to provide that rhythm it's known for, but that doesnt stop it from trying. Juvenile Noggins sometimes let their musical mishaps get out of hand, often trying to bounce with the Thumpies, with very limited success. 
Monsters/Monster_kayna_young=Young Kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_young_bio=The warm embrace of a Kayna is a welcome surprise to any monster, and theyre quite common surprises given how kind and loving the firey monsterlings tend to be. Surprisingly, mini-eruptions from its head are actually prompted by laughter and tickling!
Monsters/Monster_fluoress_young=Young Fluoress
Monsters/Monster_fluoress_young_bio=The solemn tings of the Fluoress paralarvae make for a wonderful lullabye, so much so that they have the tendency of lulling themselves to sleep while playing! In any case, Fluoress were never known for their attention-keeping habits to begin with, as they most often spend their waking hours poking and prodding at the wide array of critters that call the Floating City their home.
Monsters/Monster_theremind_young=Young Theremind
Monsters/Monster_theremind_young_bio=Young Thereminds are such mischievous minds! With their psychic abilities, they can drag objects with their minds... very VERY often. Where there is a Little Theremind, one can expect a not-so-little mess. Toys fly apart, dishes break! And now someone's dinner was right on the head of one of the monsterlings. But besides creating a "creative" mess, brainy friends have other hobbies. They like to show the crowd different tricks with disappearances, cards and animals in a hat. Despite the mischievous nature, everyone loves the young Theremind!
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_young=Young Floot Fly
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_young_bio=Whoosh! Spry Flootlings are adventurous, soaring through the skies. Never seen without their signature masks, its said they search for something lost long ago...
Monsters/Monster_clackula_young=Young Clackula
Monsters/Monster_clackula_young_bio=While normally reserved and quiet, the hands of a Clackula tot are nothing short of a handful! The occasional snip of the sharper baby teeth of a Clackula is a frightening sensation to many, though their fellow monsterlings make sure to maintain their patience. After all, Clackulas are essentially learning table manners for 3!

#BABY DOUBLES#
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_young=Young Dandidoo
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_young_bio=With that delightful tuft, the unmistakable dandidoo prefers to sit in one spot, admiring the world as it goes by. Who knows whether it forgets all it sees, or if echos of a murky past remain, tucked away within the dandelion dancer. 
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_young=Young Oaktopus
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_young_bio=While they may appear to be like leaves atop a tree, the bubbles adorning an Oaktopus sapling's crown is more akin to that of deep-sea waterfoam! While far-removed from the Living Ocean amidst The Lost World, Oaktopus youngsters still find a way to stay moist, even if it means rooting around in the local Fountain of Gob.
Monsters/Monster_maw_young=Young Maw
Monsters/Monster_maw_young_bio=It should come to no surprise that the young Maw is filled to the brim of pure water! Essentially acting as fuzzy water balloons, Maw pups quickly learn to manage their fluid intake and outtake through their highly-evolved... well, maws. While being slobbered on by a wandering Maw tongue may never be a pleasant experience to bystanders, the handlers have determined it more just means said maw wants to be your friend. aww.
Monsters/Monster_quibble_young=Young Quibble
Monsters/Monster_quibble_young_bio=The endless enthusiasm of a Quibble hatchling is one unmatched by any other monster species. Collecting all sorts of colorful pebbles to make up its training keys, their creativity is bolstered by their endless asking of questions! Of course, the celestials are always glad to assist in answering all sorts of questions, though they still can't seem to discover the answer of where baby monsters come from...
<Monsters/Monster_quibble_rare>
Monsters/Monster_phangler_young=Young Phangler
Monsters/Monster_phangler_young_bio=From abyssal depths emerges the astounding Phangler. Sporting its own photophore light show and kelp-ribbon mic, this whiz kid is destined for stardom. It'll just have to learn to keep those groupers at bay!
Monsters/Monster_stogg_young=Young Stogg
Monsters/Monster_stogg_young_bio=The astonishing arpeggios of the fledgling Stoggling have been a signature staple of the City's ambiance for as long as anyone can remember. And a bit further than that. Shockingly, young stoggs love to be buried in snow!
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead_young=Young Knucklehead
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead_young_bio=For a species known for their high motor function, one would perhaps be surprised to learn that Knuckleheads don’t start out with such skill! In truth, Knucklehead pebblings are more accustomed to sculpting nondescript globs with clay and playing with dolls than creating such delicately sculpted figures and props. Immature as they are, young Knuckleheads will often frustrate themselves with the finer details, and it is said that few have lived to tell the tale of the following temper tantrums…
Monsters/Monster_osstax_young=Young Osstax
Monsters/Monster_osstax_young_bio=It’s well-known that Osstax begins their lives as a few individuals who join together later in their life. This normally takes many, many years, as they need to fit together perfectly to become a full Osstax, but for the few individuals that find their perfect match early on, you get a scene like this one! Osstak Pebblets, despite being generally sedentary, can come up with all sorts of plans for all sorts of trouble. They’re easily able to plot with the other members of their stak, and use this extra doubled brainpower to be doubly unpredictable. You know what they say, two heads are always better than one!

#BABY TRIPLES#
Monsters/Monster_spunge_young=Young Spunge
Monsters/Monster_spunge_young_bio=PFFFFFFFNFHFGNFJBGBF. That's what a young Spunge sounds like. I'm not joking. Its adorable bro. :)
Monsters/Monster_reedling_young=Young Reedling
Monsters/Monster_reedling_young_bio=What is a flute but something fun to toot, young Reedlings always say. Or at least thats what its assumed they are trying to communicate, as gusty wheezes and adorable drooling arent quite in our database of translatable languages yet. Nevertheless, the canine cutie happily joins in on any activities the other youngsters have. 
Monsters/Monster_rootitoot_young=Young Rootitoot
Monsters/Monster_rootitoot_young_bio=The calm air that young Rootitoots provide are much appreciated solace in the boistrous and playful city. While supervised naps are offered, too many sleeping monsters around a local Rootitoot can cause a bit of a jam, and not the tasty kind. 
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_young=Young Bridg-it
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_young_bio=Young Bridg'its love bows, tiaras and anything that makes them look adorable, their hair is always well decorated and combed, however, they have such tiny arms, they can't do all this work by themselves! Luckily there is always a motherly Scaratar nearby who is willing to help them with their tangly issues.
Monsters/Monster_frondley_young=Young Frondley
Monsters/Monster_frondley_young_bio=Young Frondley bio
Monsters/Monster_trox_young=Young T-Rox
Monsters/Monster_trox_young_bio=HOW DID YOU GET THIS ONE LMAO

#BABY QUADS#
Monsters/Monster_gloptic_young=Young Gloptic
Monsters/Monster_gloptic_young_bio=Gloptic puddlings are notoriously slippery, with their specialized mucus having been spread across almost all of their body via tumbles spurred on by juvenile clumsiness. Gloptics, being a lineage adapted to far lower gravity, take a long time to get used to mobilization after all! As a result, one may think their large, exposed eyeball would be the first subject of harm, but that's not the case! Gloptic puddlings actually posess a far thicker coating around their eyeballs, like a secondary lens that is shed as they get older. However, this lens, which often gets covered by slime itself, often merely clouds the gloptic's vision further, causing yet more slips and stumbles... It's best to use padding when crafting the ideal habitat for a young Gloptic.

#BABY SEASONALS#
Monsters/Monster_punkleton_young=Young Punkleton
Monsters/Monster_punkleton_young_bio=Boo! Young Punkletons are said to have emerged from the pumpkins that litter the Floating City, enchanted by the harvest moon. The gourdly ghouls love to creep up behind fellow monsterlings, before surprising them- with loads of tasty treats!

#UHH#
Monsters/Monster_goku=Goku
Monsters/Monster_goku_bio=Goku is a powerful being. He could kill the Wubbox himself, with just one hand!

#ADULT OFFICIAL SINGLES#
Monsters/Monster_potbelly=Potbelly
Monsters/Monster_potbelly_bio=The adult potbelly is a loud and extroverted creature, constantly babbling nonsense to everyone who can hear. Whilst other monsters would love to stay around and listen, eventually a potbelly may take off its pot and settle into the jabber, sometimes not even noticing the rooty tendrils engulfing it’s eager listener. Luckily, these days monsters have learned to stay away or gently remind the potbelly, and things go smooth from there.
Monsters/Monster_mammott=Mammott
Monsters/Monster_mammott_bio=Mammott bio
Monsters/Monster_tweedle=Tweedle
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_bio=Psst? Did you hear that? The featherbrained Tweedle probably did! This gossip gathering monster is known for its abysmal secret-keeping ability- but all the fellow monsters keep it around, for its signature calming coo.
Monsters/Monster_toejammer=Toe Jammer
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_bio=Adult Toe Jammers have a great bubbly personality and are very good swimmers when they live in the water. Also known to get invited to many parties and picnics with their fellow friend Floot-Fly, they know how to have a good time!!!
Monsters/Monster_noggin=Noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_bio=Seemingly carved from the earth itself, Noggins share a certain pride in being one of the eldest natural monster lineages. For as long as there’s been soil to overturn, Noggins have been tumbling about the landscapes with an ever-iconic Thump! However, with a recent influx of monsters discovered to also be created via statues, some have questioned if the rocky exterior of the Noggin is indicative of some divine creation… though that’s too philosophical of a question for a Noggin to contemplate itself. After all, as is their namesake, a Noggin’s most noteworthy trait beyond their craggy carapace is an incredibly thick skull.
Monsters/Monster_kayna=Kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_bio=With a fire in its belly and inferno in its heart, the Kayna is always blowing its top in an eruption of joyful song. The juvenile Kayna is popular at parties, enthusiastically roasting marshmallows for everyone.
Monsters/Monster_fluoress=Fluoress
Monsters/Monster_fluoress_bio=A fluoress may seem dim and dull, but that's just a facade. When in song with fellow monsters, Fluoress happily prods its dress of Fluorophyll, lighting up the darkness. While the reason for this strange reaction, as well as the origins of Fluorophyll, are quite a mystery, Fluoress gently reminds that one need not understand to appreciate. 
Monsters/Monster_theremind=Theremind
Monsters/Monster_theremind_bio=A theremind's rubbery brain may cause some alarm to those inexperienced in monster biology. I mean, it's out in the open for all to see! However, rest assured, a theremind's noodle is well-protected by a thick outer skin, which protects it from all sorts of tumbles and falls. It's not like they walk often anyways, it's far more efficient to simply float about!
Monsters/Monster_flootfly=Floot Fly
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_bio=The mystical Floot Fly is one of the most common monsters to stumble upon throughout the Lost Landscapes, as it's one of the friendliest monsters around! Floot-Flies love to throw tea parties in the most bizarre locations too! Invites to a tea party are always revered and accepted gleefully, as it's a great place to socialize and gossip!
Monsters/Monster_clackula=Clackula
Monsters/Monster_clackula_bio=Dapper Clackula doesn't have a mouth of its own with which to chitter-chatter about its many cultured interests, so the Bone Elemental leaves all the yammering to its loquacious little hands. If only they'd behave! When the lanky gentle-Mon's appendages get too snippy with dinner guests, it delivers the quickest of pin-point pinches to each chatterbox with its dainty fangs. While not enough to cause any pain, it's certainly enough to send a message: keep it classy!

#ADULT OFFICIAL DOUBLES#
Monsters/Monster_furcorn=Furcorn
Monsters/Monster_furcorn_bio=This tiny, delicate creature maintains a steady internal temperature by fluffing or flattening its silky green pelt. Furcorns are special. Protect them.
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo=Dandidoo
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_bio=As the warm flows of the ocean carry oysters around the deeps, a gentle breeze carries Dandidoo across the monster world. Their migrations rely on airflow since nature wasn't kind enough to grant them wings. They can conduct the air through their bodies to store and burst it out in a powerful stream of tuned tones and semitones. That's why their singing resembles "doo"s and "dee"s.\nTheir plant element gave them a greenish hue and afro-styled hair reminiscent of a common dandelion.
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus=Oaktopus
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_bio=This amphibious hybrid of Plant and Water is comfortable in any environment. The Monster's 'roots' are actually powerful tentacles that carry the Oaktopus rapidly across landscapes, and propel it efficiently through water.
Monsters/Monster_pango=Pango
Monsters/Monster_pango_bio=One would not expect a monster born of Air and Cold to be flightless and perpetually chilly, however, this is the Pango's reality. The Pango must content itself with remaining on the ground and chattering, playing its part in the endless chorus.
Monsters/Monster_maw=Maw
Monsters/Monster_maw_bio=The eyeless Maw is a refined combination of Cold and Water elements. Its dense fur acts as a general sensory organ, and provides efficient insulation to maintain a liquid body interior. Maws are a little mouthy. Tonguey too.
Monsters/Monster_quibble=Quibble
Monsters/Monster_quibble_bio=The Quibble may seem like a graceful monster on the outside, but that's just a facade. The two heads constantly bicker, usually having polar opinions about the latest trends, or some other trivial issue. One time, the left Quibble wanted to order fries, but the right Quibble was eager to get a milkshake... chaos ensued. But in the end, they always make up with each other, like true siblings. Oh yeah, they ended up ordering fries dunked in a milkshake. A... unique consensus
Monsters/Monster_boskus=Boskus
Monsters/Monster_boskus_bio=If you value your dignity, never challenge a Boskus to a thumb war! Years of lip-flubbering with its nasal digit have given this silly Monster a finger strong enough to lift broken-down Diggers and uproot even the most stubborn of stumps. Never trust Boskus.
Monsters/Monster_phangler=Phangler
Monsters/Monster_phangler_bio=On water and on land, a Phangler’s sure to lend a hand! Or.. a fin? A tail? No matter, this studio-set swimmer’s a welcome addition to any party, ready to wow the stage. During off hours, Phanglers are known to listen to podcasts and make quinoa smoothies- bleargh…
Monsters/Monster_denchuhs=Denchuhs
Monsters/Monster_denchuhs_bio=The pint-sized Denchuhs are a lot like a pair of your grandaddy's dentures: they're at their best when they're together, but often fall out! Occasional spats are an inevitability when looks are so identical, yet personalities are more contrary than fire and ice: gabby versus glum, sanguine versus stoic, and bubbly versus been-there-done-that. But at the end of a long day, all these little Denchuhs want is a hefty snack in their mega-mouths and the comfort of a held hand.
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead=Knucklehead
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead_bio=The burly mitts of a matured Knucklehead may be intimidating, but it assures the handlers it would never use such strength for ill-intentioned activities. In fact, we find that most Knuckleheads spend their days playing Critters and Catacombs with their monster cohorts. Who would know that a creature with the name Knucklehead would be such an experienced storyteller!
Monsters/Monster_osstax=Osstax
Monsters/Monster_osstax_bio=Not unlike other species in the Monster World, Osstax begins as disparate individuals who find each other and join together to make a whole greater than the sum of its parts. This can be a tricky process, though, as it's important for the individual beings to fit together perfectly, both physically and as a kinship group. The bottom Osstak is generally understood to be the leader and most important of the three, although there have been exceptions. The bony enamel of their exteriors, matched with the intricacy of their chambered interiors, produce a haunting wheeze that is identifiable across the entire Sanctum.
Monsters/Monster_cybop=Cybop
Monsters/Monster_cybop_bio=Much more than mere gizmos, Cybops are deep thinkers, and vibrantly alive. Occasionally, Cybops need reminders that attempting to scavenge the body parts of other Monsters for personal repair is not socially acceptable.

#ADULT OFFICIAL TRIPLES#
Monsters/Monster_spunge=Spunge
Monsters/Monster_spunge_bio=Adult Spunges are very talented whistlers, they can blow so hard that sometimes they send fellow monsters off to faraway islands!!! Just Remember to take cover when they blow their birthday candles.
Monsters/Monster_clamble=Clamble
Monsters/Monster_clamble_bio=The vine-like Clamble protects its tender Plant head with flat metallic shells. As it grows, it saves the cast-off plates. While the element of Cold is in its family tree, the Clamble's green parts do not tolerate freezing.
Monsters/Monster_reedling=Reedling
Monsters/Monster_reedling_bio=Reedlings live and breathe music - literally. Somewhere in their evolution they forgot how to breathe through mouths and noses, so they developed flute-like breathing spines. Reedlings sometimes release the odd toot in their sleep.
Monsters/Monster_rootitoot=Rootitoot
Monsters/Monster_rootitoot_bio=Rootitoots are natural-born hosts, blessing many a soirée with a knack for storytelling, an enviable wit, and general zest for life. A Rootitoot's dinner party traditionally offers as many dishes as it can carry upon its tubular vents, doubled. But don't overburden this Monster... oh, great... you had to have the Biiiiig Salad!
Monsters/Monster_bridgit=Bridg-it
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_bio=While stereotypes say trolls are generally cruel and live in basements, Bridg-it's quite the opposite. This melodic monster is one of the kindest one'll meet, constantly hosting tea parties, bridge building competitions, and much more. Well we think so, we havent seen it really do... anything besides those two things. 
Monsters/Monster_frondley=Frondley
Monsters/Monster_frondley_bio=The Frondley is an ammmmmmmmmmazing specimen! Its gelatinous physique and toes bring to mind some similar monsters, but they have evolved separately from our lemon-colored companions. Their otherworldly and serene hums echo throughout islands, always making sure a Frondley's presence is known. Some monsters go as far as to record these hums to lure themselves to sleep. In other activities, Frondley enjoys maintaining their kelpy hairdos, while always striving to find the perfect amount of hair for their bulbous craniums.
Monsters/Monster_trox=T-Rox
Monsters/Monster_trox_bio=The T-Rox exudes enthusiasm and energy, displaying flashing spikelets and chomping jaws. Monsters with toes should steer well clear of the T-Rox.

#ADULT OFFICIAL QUADS#
Monsters/Monster_deedge=Deedge
Monsters/Monster_deedge_bio=The Deedge, attuned to the beat of the Earth, pulls together multiple elements to produce a complex beat. A tireless, energetic performer, it keeps all the Monsters dancing.
Monsters/Monster_pongping=PongPing
Monsters/Monster_pongping_bio=There's a persistent cliché that you can either be a music fan or a sports nut, but not both - and the PongPing proves otherwise! Even though its vermiform body is better suited to standing activities like table tennis, the Monster also loves embarking on cross-island marathons, no matter how long they take. To keep its spirits up on the way, the PongPing uses its paddles to practice a series of rhythmic rudiments on its inflatable cheeks. When intense weather or fatigue threaten to discourage, the Monster likes to remember the optimistic adage its forebears always used to say: "Life is like a music box of Chokkolits... wait, why are there Chokkolits in a music box? What a mess! Oh well, let's get started on clean-up." We know, it's kind of convoluted.
Monsters/Monster_tiawa=Tiawa
Monsters/Monster_tiawa_bio=Proven as a keen leader, the Tiawa’s very presence suggests a soothing sageness. In the face of adversity, the queenly Quad simply flourishes its crown of planks, and undertakes any situation or challenge with the help of its noble hearts (it grows a second one alongside a second eye as it ages). For many years, Monsters have followed the knowledgeable beat of Tiawa’s drumming digits as it crafts subtle melodies. Even today, Tiawa continues to give priceless counsel to anyone, and will for generations to come.
Monsters/Monster_bisonorus=Bisonorus
Monsters/Monster_bisonorus_bio=	It takes TWO to tango, and in this case it takes TWO to sing as well. Together since birth, these Fire Monsters have a great knack for communication (usually one telling the other what TWO do). With the diminutive Emperor Bisonorus atop the burly Standard Bisonorus, they are unstoppably fearless - except that one time when the latter had to crisis-manage the former's dignity after an unusual wardrobe malfunction involving some possibly imaginary clothes. With each supporting the other, they always seem to have can-TWO attitudes.
Monsters/Monster_shellbeat=Shellbeat
Monsters/Monster_shellbeat_bio=Shellbeats are naturally shy and like to keep hidden away in their shells. When they are woken up by their neighbors' loud singing they tend to loosen up, come out of their shell, and play along as best they can with their aquatic drum set. Shellbeats have gotten pretty good at playing lately.

#MARSH FANMADES#
Monsters/Monster_likho=Yap
Monsters/Monster_likho_bio=If you see a Yap, just know that you've just run into a nice chap! Yaps are small little tumbleweeds, rolling around picking up all sorts of plant life, and usually gifting some to others, even if they don't like it as much as the gifter. But not only that, when it stops, it prepares a... "wonderful" song for its comrades, which usually results in its audience screaming "MAKE IT STOP!" Don't know what that's about.
Monsters/Monster_varrow=Varrow
Monsters/Monster_varrow_bio=Known for its penchant for hunting, the melodic “Yah-ha-ha!” of the Varrow echoes throughout all corners of the Evergreen Swamp. It uses its call and prolonged noseharp to attempt to attract juvenile fwogs to its corner of the swamp, even though it might not work as often as it likes. In fact, its attempts more often scare its slippery prey away, leaving the Varrow fwogless and alone. It’s a sad thing too, since it truly just wants new customers to sample their fresh home-made sweets!
Monsters/Monster_wadee=Wadee
Monsters/Monster_wadee_bio=Deep below the murkiest of murky depths lies an underwater land lost to time. Many monsters have resided here, and in recent times, many from this region have adventured to the surface. If one takes a swim at the foggy center of the Evergreen Woods’ bog pools then you might hear the soggy "why" like sounds of a Wadee, one such explorer. While it was a beautiful fish in the deep, exposure to the surface has fundamentally changed it, causing its gills to shrink, it’s flippers to turn to hands, and it’s body to swell slightly. While seeming minor, these changes mean that the Wadee can no longer make the long underwater trek back home. The Wadee takes it kindly though, and uses its glowing pads to help guide other underwater travelers, and is a friend to many above and below the surface. Deep inside though, Wadee misses the sights of its home coral reef and the sounds of the Cancer Choir’s melodious tunes…
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan=Dulsylvan
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_bio=The carved Dulsylvan, a creature of wood and weathering, held together by its solid core, may seem a tad bit rude on first encounter. Known to never speak, and always donning a scowl, Dulsylvan’s bad mood is naught more than circumstance, as it’s mouth has long been cemented in that shape. In truth, the true monster lives in the small creatures that reside upon the only truly life-filled part of the being, it’s lofty twigs. These creatures, sometimes referred to as Sylvlings, cover and open holes on their ailing ancestors branches to allow air through, and giving the Dulsylvan a means of communication with its neighbors. Once Dulsylvan mystically changes into a pine cone, the Sylvlings will begin to grow and change rapidly, into young Dulsylvans of their own!
Monsters/Monster_choral=Choralle
Monsters/Monster_choral_bio=Huh? This seems to be an ordinary tree, but consider us fooled, as this is the shy protege of the Cancer Choir, Choralle! These small masters of natural trickery use a tree-like figure for protection, usually hiding from bigger monsters who usually mean no harm, as they just want to say hello! But being the introverted species they are, the Choralle produce a powerful slam with their disguise if someone gets too close. It may seem rude, but it's just instinct, which we can't blame them for.
Monsters/Monster_banno=Banno
Monsters/Monster_banno_bio=Banno is a vocalist of the legendary Cancer Choir, for a long time he spent his time in the deep cold depths of the ocean. Sadly though, it was far too cold for his hot water-loving body! Instead of moving into a geyser of some sort, he decided to stay close to his friends, utilizing an endlessly boiling bucket to keep comfy. Whilst his boiling red abdomen may be concerning, there’s no need to worry- Banno states that it’s just his natural color showing after the cleaning of thousands of years of sea gunk.
Monsters/Monster_stoopa=Stoopa
Monsters/Monster_stoopa_bio=Not much is known about the misty marsh deep in the heart of the Evergreen Woods, but legends speak of a strange monster that watches over and leads the song of the monsters that reside there. And whaddya know, here it is! Stoopa is even more of a recycling expert than Congle, finding anything and everything in nature to produce its song, even if it has to make some exceptions with its nature-based rule at times- proven by those... pots and pans on its stupa? Still very little is known about it, and Stoopa prefers to keep it that way while it wields its strange staff, and guards the secrets of the Marsh.

Monsters/Monster_jobo=Jodel
Monsters/Monster_jobo_bio=As sweetened Werdo, Jodel knows alot about Candy Island's colossal, as it knows how it was made, but it knows every single monster's likes as Jodel knew when Jam Boree will arrive.

Monsters/Monster_knife=Banchi
Monsters/Monster_knife_bio=Banchi is the beloved mythical of Candy Island. For years untold, the Banchi have been making the popular glutinous rice snack that is the monster-mochi, through which they also play their unique song. A rumor says that they use a secret ingredient to make their monster-mochi make a sound on impact, but no-one really knows what it is. Some speculations suggest that a certain feline spectral figure helped them out- someone who Banchi refers to as family.

Monsters/Monster_wheezel=Wheezel
Monsters/Monster_wheezel_bio=Pop! goes the Wheezel… or maybe it's more like a plop. Of course the Earth Mythical would dream up some bizarre, sibilating automaton like this. Of course it would be based on a classic prank like a jack-in-the-box. Of course the Dreamythical's outer shell would be adorned with the same unusual symbols that cover its creator's pelt. Long before its creation in the dreamspace, toys just like it would find their way into the possession of beings across the Monster World, and would subject the unsuspecting to a startling surprise - undoubtedly the handiwork of its progenitor. A Monster of this style calls to mind the unusual life-forms of Wublin Island; it just goes to show that if you can dream it, the power of dreamcraft will make it a reality!

Monsters/Monster_wheezel_rock=Wheezel Rock
Monsters/Monster_wheezel_rock_bio=Use some resources to carve and polish this special Hummatite rock, and form it into a Dreamythical from dreams long forgotten.

Monsters/Monster_knurv=Knurv
Monsters/Monster_knurv_bio=Over the course of its multiversal sojourns, the Fire Haven Mythical has had the opportunity to observe and partake of various cultures and civilizations. It's particularly interested in folklore, but there's one legend that has gripped its imagination from the first moment it heard it - that of the Knurv. Known by another name in its native dimension, tales relate that this 'bogeyMon' of sorts extends its elongated optic nerves to spy on others without their knowledge. On Mythical Island, it has been reimagined using dreamcraft as an enthusiastic musical performer; using its optic nerves not for spying, but for creating captivating melodies reminiscent of its Mythical creator.

Monsters/Monster_reebro=Reebro
Monsters/Monster_reebro_bio=Of all the creatures known in the multiverse, the Reebro is right up there with the strangest. Little more than an oversized brain to begin with, this Ethereal beast develops a mechanical body using its instinctual technological know-how. The Reebro, or simply 'Bro' as it is affectionately called by its fellow Monsters, is a laid-back character who lives for fun and has the scoop on all the latest trends. It's always willing to assist others with their 'Mech'-nical difficulties - even if its go-to solution is to 'turn it off and then turn it on again.

Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof=Wubbox
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_bio=One day as the monsters were tunneling underground, they stumbled upon an immense underground vault containing several of the mysterious objects known as the Wubbox. Very little is known of their origin or purpose, save a few observations:\n\nSample analysis of the box's exterior indicates that it shares traits with every known monster species - in fact, it even has specialized compartments with an otherworldy shrinking technology. The box is also imbued with an elemental energy unfamiliar to those on the surface - a shocking discovery, to say the least.\n\nGather some intrepid monster volunteers and see what happens when you 'box' them!
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_awake=<ref>Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_awake_bio=Eureka! The Wubbox awakes! As it turns out, this extraordinary electric elemental is vital to the life processes of the colossal island monsters that the other singing denizens call home.  The shrunken monsters used to power up the creature report that inside is as fun as any playground they've ever seen, so they are happy to stay indefinitely.The robotic chirps and whistles it uses to express itself can take some getting used to, but eventually become a beloved and inextricable part of the island's tune.  Besides, it's all the rage in "current" music.The specific breeding characteristics of the Wubbox have not yet been studied.

Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof=Rare Wubbox
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof_bio=Unlike the common Wubbox, the Rare can be bought for a song - as long as you're singing the right tune. In this inactive state, it's hard to tell what physically differentiates the two monsters, but the most striking contrast is the Rare Wubbox's modest bed count - it's only one! We're hoping to learn more once this cryptic creature is powered up with monsters and awakens to share its song.\n\nGet going with the boxing! Your common Monsters just won't do - this picky customer only accepts Rares.
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof_awake=<ref>Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof_awake_bio=The story goes that this monster yearned to learn more about the human world, and embarked on a journey through the multiverse. It's now obvious that the Wubbox hurtled not only through space, but also time, towards its destination. Upon its return, it extolled the virtues of revolutionary music tech like turntables, keytars and vocoders. Thanks to its talent for self-customization, the Wubbox integrated pieces of its discoveries into its very being, forever altering its shape, song, and completing its transformation into the sensational Rare Wubbox.

Monsters/Monster_poewk_awake_bio=Is that the Poewk's face, or is it a mask procured from parts unknown? If it is indeed a mask... Why? Is it bashful? Cold? Ghastly to behold? Or is this Wublin simply into cosplay? That would explain a lot. The Poewk's musical performance is a mesmerizing display of frantic grace and composed frenzy.

Monsters/Monster_fleechwurm_undof_awake_bio=In addition to using them to play music, some Monsters take advantage of their unique features and body shapes, and use them for other purposes. In the case of the Fleechwurm, its resonant body cavity can generate a series of whistles that have an unusual hypnotic effect on other Wublins. They can be used to coax others into doing unglamorous chores for it, or to lovingly preen its leaf-like limbs. Some Wublins are more resistant than others, and playfully admonish the Fleechwurm so it doesn't become too mischievous.

Monsters/Monster_spunge_rare=Rare Spunge
Monsters/Monster_spunge_rare_bio=The dry-eyed Rare Spunge is a fascinating example of the adaptations that environment based mutations can bring about.

Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare_bio=During the late stages of a Dulsylvan’s time, it’s body begins to rapidly change. Old, solid wood morphs into a light airy shape, known as a sylvcone. The Dulsylvan’s body begins to ooze a sweet sap, that will feed its young Sylvlings after it has passed on, and it’s nose changes to a luscious green shade. While these latter days are considered to be short, they are known to be filled with joy, as the old Dulsylvan becomes able to move freely once more! Eventually though, it slows down, and the sap crystallizes the sylvcone and preserves it for eternity…

Like most of the Faerie Forests' inhabitants, this monster's existence is tied heavily to the Flora Fog. While we still don’t know exactly what it does, the Fog seems to amplify Meloch-Ness’s to melodic tunes and carry far and wide. Its enchanting melody can be heard from a whole forest away when it's is carried by the Flora Fog. In fact, it was the first thing the natural monsters heard when they arrived in the Deep Woods. Meloch-Ness is also said to share a common ancestor with Reedling and Blabbit.

Its bark is almost pertified and impenetrable by most of the vermins and predators. Yet a particular species of "Plantcarver nymph" have developed strong teeth that can gnaw away the stone bark and settle inside of the everblue. The tree's bark is extremely resonant from the inside. Allowing nymths to sing while inside and resonate a deep-throated, ear-piercing sound. The holes carved away by the nymphs resemble a face to scare away unwanted guests and attend on the yearly spooktackle decoration contest.

Fleeing the abysmal depths of its former home, BoOoo embarked on a long and widespread journey for a new home. Eventually, it found a strange mountain, deep below the Silver Crags, that emitted a strange feeling that resonated with BoOoo. At first staying to investigate, the cryptic aura of the region has convinced BoOoo to finally choose a true home for the first time in millennia. However, no gift comes without its price, and without careful consumption of local materials, the region’s alien magic might take hold on BoOoo and the other residents in strange ways… 
Monsters/Knott_5=Mount Tuzzpikk
Monsters/Knott_5_bio=Mount Tuzzpikk was a regular Knott-rock that got affected by the Knottsurr magic, emmited from the mystical orbs found across the Knottsurr Island. It gained musical abilities and immediately after being animated, started to sing. It knows many compositions but "Pearrdesh Slougna" and "Ellepharrth" by "DJ. Goldenduck" is the closest to its rock heart. You can find it humming the melody non-stop whenever it's not singing.\nLeaving the island would result in reverting to its initial state of non-sentience. Unless it carries one of the sources of Knottsurr magic with it wherever it goes.

These monsters sure know how to enjoy life.

What's seen on the outside of this passive monster is merely a suit of armor, with its "helmet" portion enlarged by the wielding of discarded armor from its youth. Its organic aspects lie beneath its metallic sheathing, with the only visible parts being a singular eye (it lost the other one) and two twig-like legs (surprisingly strong given the burden of lifting its armor). Depending on its environment, a Whimstlop can don an armor of a different material to fit its current needs. Sometimes they work as part-time leafblowers, expelling much of the dirt and grime its other monster pals bring in.

Monsters/Monster_syncopite=Syncopite
Monsters/Monster_syncopite_bio=The Syncopite​ was born of a seismic event during which the silence of the primordial cosmic hush grew so heavy, it collapsed under its own weight and compressed into a dense, luminous mass.

Monsters/Monster_vhamp=Vhamp
Monsters/Monster_vhamp_bio=After eons spent as a sentient, though incorporeal, mass of energy, the Vhamp finally got itself together – quite literally – and constructed its own physical form from random detritus scattered about the universe. More self-assembled than self-actualized, the Vhamp nonetheless seeks to discover its true self through musical experimentation and purposeful self-reflection. With its pipes, gears, bellows, and levers, the Vhamp is an extraordinary aggregate of basic parts working in complex harmony. It exhibits a steady tempo, smooth airflow dynamics, and wobbly suspension.
Monsters/Monster_furnoss=Furnoss
Monsters/Monster_furnoss_bio=The Furnoss is said to have been forged in the living core of Fire and then expelled into the stars above in a prehistoric eruption.

Monsters/Monster_light_bio=How ludicrous! The lanky Loch-nitt is a truly strange being, with an impressive neck, and long legs- or are they arms? Nobody is quite sure, including the Loch-nitt itself; The lavender legend just calls them l'arms! When not questioning it's own existence, this monster mystery's passions include knitting neck socks, stumbling over just about anything, and passionately playing it's clumsy heart out on its lyrologs.

Structures/Structure_breeding=Breeding Structure
Structures/Structure_breeding_bio=This peculiar structure has been in use since the golden age of the Monster World, and little has changed since that time. Once it is old enough, a Monster can spontaneously produce an egg containing all of its genetic and elemental information, which is then placed onto one of the 'bowls' of the machine. These eggs, which are truly more like spores, slowly seep out their 'precious bodily fluids' down the twin drains of the structure and magically co-mingle in the center vessel, until a new egg is produced!

Structures/Structure_breeding_undof=<ref>Structures/Structure_breeding
Structures/Structure_breeding_undof_bio=This peculiar structure has been in use since the golden age of the Monster World, and little has changed since that time. Once it is old enough, a Monster can spontaneously produce an egg containing all of its genetic and elemental information, which is then placed onto one of the 'bowls' of the machine. These eggs, which are truly more like spores, slowly seep out their 'precious bodily fluids' down the twin drains of the structure and magically co-mingle in the center vessel, until a new egg is produced! The process is complicated though, as one breeding combination can have many possible outcomes.
Structures/Structure_breeding_undof2=Enhanced Breeding Structure
Structures/Structure_breeding_undof2_bio=Breeding is tricky business at the best of times, so every little advantage helps. Thanks to the invaluable field research that has been collected over the past two years, the complex interplay of elemental powers is now better understood than ever before! This Enhanced Breeding Structure cuts breeding wait times by 25%!
Structures/Structure_breeding_undof3=Sweetened Breeding Structure
Structures/Structure_breeding_undof3_bio=Despite the faster wait times of the Enhanced Breeding Structure, breeding can still be a quite a tricky matter... Luckily, the newly Sweetened Breeding Structure can help! Upgraded through various items & resources from the Candy Island, the highly-efficient Sweetened Breeding Structure reduces breeding waiting times by 50%, more than ever before!


Structures/Structure_castle_undof=Basic Castle
Structures/Structure_castle_undof_bio=Singing takes a lot of energy, and monsters need sleep! The Basic Castle really isn't very comfy at all; the rain gets through, it's drafty, and cramped.

Structures/Structure_castle_undof2=Modest Castle
Structures/Structure_castle_undof2_bio=It's great to have a good night's sleep! The Modest Castle is dry and warm, but small.

Structures/Structure_castle_undof3=Comfortable Castle

Structures/Structure_castle_undof5=Luxurious Castle

Structures/Structure_castle_undof6=Extravagant Castle
Structures/Structure_castle_undof6_bio=This state of the art domicile goes way overboard when it comes to spoiling the monsters...  Personal assistants to wait on them hand and foot (at least those that have hands and feet), the spiffiest sound systems on the monster market...  They've got it made in the shade.

Structures/Structure_jukebox=Jukebox
Structures/Structure_jukebox_bio=Heralding from days long past, the Jukebox still sports memorabilia from musical connoisseurs hoping to jam out after the day is done. While a sparklier version appears to have been modeled for a distant haven, this older prototype found its way here, where it is adored by all the younglings. Since they can’t sing, they crowd around and happily listen, deriving inspiration and absorbing raw creativity from the fantastical frequencies emmitted from within.

Structures/Structure_bass=Bass machine
Structures/Structure_bass_bio=The Bass Machine is a cutting edge mix of art and technology, originating from the age of the Great Burgundy Incident. While the knowledge to create more was lost long ago, many can be found lying around in buildings across the floating city. These strange machines are known to be far more intelligent than any other being within the known realm, but yet cannot communicate with the outside world, leaving them to hum and strum bass notes hoping to be understood…

Structures/Structure_knottmaker1=Strange contraption
Structures/Structure_knottmaker1_bio=Hmm... what could this strange contraption possibly be? Gather some resources around the island to find out!

Monsters/Monster_kayna_undof=<ref>Monsters/Monster_kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_undof_bio=The ancient Kayna was long thought lost to an enigmatic event in monster antiquity. A solitary specimen encased in amber was rescued on Tribal Island. It's true, but only recently did a new generation of these beings begin to appear, beckoned by the mysterious call of Relics resonating deep within the world's volcanic core. Now this feisty Fire Elemental is ready to play its part in restoring the glory of its powerful Element in the Monster World.

Monsters/Monster_kayna_rare_undof=Rare Kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_rare_undof_bio=Bearers of the oldest Element of all, Rare Kaynas are an ancient breed from which all their Common cousins have sprung. Their intricate, tattoo-like carvings are bestowed upon them with great honor to represent their impressive age and crowing wisdom, eon after eon; you can imagine that the oldest Rare Kaynas are quite a sight! Yet no matter how old the original Fire Rare gets, the burning glow of the Fire Element never dims.

Monsters/Monster_noggin_undof=<ref>Monsters/Monster_noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_undof_bio=Noggins are basically musical rocks. Deeply in tune with the Earth, their simple rhythms echo an Island’s pulse. The sensation of reverberation produced by a Noggin motivates all other monsters.

Monsters/Monster_noggin_rare_undof=Rare Noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_rare_undof_bio=After scouring the World for what felt like forever, the Rare Noggin has been unearthed. Not satisfied with a simple existence as a musical rock, this capricious creature reinvented itself as the building block of an exotic edifice. Because of their limited maneuverability, it's unclear whether a group of Rare Noggins could ever actually cooperate to build anything... perhaps a more down-to-Earth goal would be to just keep the rhythm for its fellow monsters.

Monsters/Monster_fwog_undof=Fwog
Monsters/Monster_fwog_undof_bio=Emerging from its muddy birthplace, the Fwog sings passionately in the hope of attracting a companion. Its hypnotic call fills the air, stirring the most primal feelings of excitement in all Monsters.

Monsters/Monster_thrumble_undof=Thrumble
Monsters/Monster_thrumble_undof_bio=Wide-mouthed and keen snackers, Thrumbles are prone to swallowing treats whole. Their elongated gullets can squash and stretch to provide said treats with ample time to be pulverized by the reverberations of this happy-go-lucky hummer's signature thrumming. When thrumming on an empty stomach, bubbling pockets of air can expand and prompt a sudden flurry of giggles!

Monsters/Monster_phangler_undof=<ref>Monsters/Monster_phangler
Monsters/Monster_phangler_undof_bio=Phanglers are destined for a life in the limelight! These Natural-born crooners live to perform, and their dulcet tones are frequently employees at all manner of shindigs.

Monsters/Monster_stogg_undof=Stogg
Monsters/Monster_stogg_undof_bio=As avid rock collectors, Stoggs relish digging into the earth with their powerful forelegs to find shiny new minerals. Unfortunately, this absentminded monster also enjoys burying their treasure, often forgetting the location soon after.

Monsters/Monster_gumtromp=Gumtromp
Monsters/Monster_gumtromp_bio=A sweet demeanored treat, the adorable Gumtromp parades around the monster world, giving inspirational speeches on how... candy is actually good for you and how the toothbrush mafia is out to get everyone. Yikes. But besides that, this marmalade monster loves to help its friends and caters plenty of sweets for events of any size. What a sugary delight! 

Monsters/Monster_gumtromp_rare=Rare Gumtromp
Monsters/Monster_gumtromp_rare_bio=A seemingly normal monster has a sweet secret! Their chocolate-covered heads are no ordinary treat but hold an amazing surprise. When consumed, every other snack becomes infused with an irresistibly sweet flavor!

Monsters/Monster_keytrus=Keytrus
Monsters/Monster_keytrus_bio=Like its surprisingly-close kin, the Koodahcane, Keytrus is far-disconnected from its fellow candy monsters via its complete inedibility! In fact, Keytrus often find themselves scavenging about the surface of the Konficshonn colossal for sour sweets and delicacies! This sweet -- or, rather, sour -- tooth is only satiated by the disc-shaped fruits found growing in the colossal's beard. It then uses specialized claws at the tips of its limbs, normally covered by leaflike feathers, to slice the orange in half, revealing 4 quadrants of flesh that can be tapped to produce a wonderfully whimsical tink! These fruits, called Discus Fruits by the other monsters, are actually not sour at all, but Keytrus doesn't know that... don't ruin its fun.

Monsters/Monster_keytrus_rare=Rare Keytrus
Monsters/Monster_keytrus_rare_bio=In a world that glorifies needs, Flasq'ua liberates your Wants. Wanta Flasq'ua? Well this little creature can help you with that! The Rare Keytrus mostly hides in rocks so other monsters won't drink them because it looks like the small drink the Normal monsters drink (it also drinks it's own kind, so it's a cannibal.).  Inside it's body is acid, like literal acid that melts stuff. So DONT actually try to drink Rare Keytrus.

Monsters/Monster_koodahcane=Koodahcane
Monsters/Monster_koodahcane_bio=The sweetening antlers of the Koodahcane are beloved by all inhabitants of the Candy Island. All sugar in the bloodstream of these scaly fish are accumulated on the tip of their skull and grown like hair. When it reaches a tipping point, Once a month or so, these sucrose-filled cranial canes are shed and left to be collected around the island, as sweet treats. 

Monsters/Monster_marshflamo=Marshflamo
Monsters/Monster_marshflamo_bio=Marshflamos are known to be some of the most warm hearted monsters out there- quite literally, given their molten gooey marshmallowey cores! As time goes on, Marshflamos age through their rapid life cycle, their internal heat toasting them to perfection, before they harden and set ablaze. Their crumbling black shell falls off and reveals a shining new exterior, pure and light as a cloud. As residents of the newly formed sugary refuge in the Pocket Dimension, from the disaster that destroyed the Monster World, Marshflamos work to keep their fellow monsters safe, while telling spooky stories around an ever toasty campfire. 

Monsters/Monster_brasscuit=Brasscuit
Monsters/Monster_brasscuit_bio=The legend says that a while ago a common ancestor of the Brasscuit and the Stogg got stranded on Candy Island. Initially the new environment was too harsh for the newcomers, but their hard working nature let them adapt and overcome the new challenges, and slowly the species formed into the Brasscuit we know today! Their acoustic horns are self-made, and sewn from the toughest licorice that can be found on the island. Brasscuits are expert foragers, and can smell a good snack from across the island. 

Monsters/Monster_gobstomper=Gobstomper
Monsters/Monster_gobstomper_bio=It's said that Gobstompers are the toughest of candy monsters. Their layered shells can withstand the highest of falls and the heaviest of punches without a single chip. Despite all that, the Gobstompers' personalities reflect their chewy, gummy interiors. They are always ready to help out around Candy Island, and wherever else they may roam. Still, from time to time they may yet find themselves eager for some friendly competition for who has the sturdiest crust with their hard-headed friends.

Monsters/Monster_claramel=Claramel
Monsters/Monster_claramel_bio=The ever-shimmering Claramel is known for its caramelized form and playful tunes. But it wasn't always that way, and at one point it was in a liquid state, scathing and sticky. But an encounter with a Reedling inspired Claramel! It attached DIY cinnamon pipes to its tail and practiced tirelessly. Eventually the winds passing through froze its body in a crystalline dynamic splash that made it all the more memorable and beloved.

Monsters/Monster_sprinklate=Sprinklate
Monsters/Monster_sprinklate_bio=As the tasty team leader of Candy Island, almost everyone has heard of Sprinklate at some point or another. They love to lead various activities on the island, are enthusiastic members of the island's guard, and keep a watchful eye on all. Though Sprinklate loves all of their friends equally, they have a special spot in their heart for a fellow cake, who visits once a year. 

Monsters/Monster_jamboree_undof=Jam Boree
Monsters/Monster_jamboree_undof_bio=To say that the Seasonal Shanty is Jam-packed with goodwill and jubilation would be accurate, and that's largely thanks to the presence of the Jam Boree! For many years, the self-styled leader of the Shanty has taken it upon itself to try to organize the Seasonal trappings that festoon every corner of the floating hideaway. It's a very patient Monster, who looks forward every year to Anniversary Month when it throws a huge party for the migratory Seasonals coming home to roost! Jam Boree appreciates when Treats other than Cake are served at such shindigs.

Monsters/Monster_ghazt_undof=Ghazt
Monsters/Monster_ghazt_undof_bio=The extraordinary Ghazt only manifests itself when conditions are absolutely perfect. Imbued with the Ethereal power of Plasma, its sleek frame and ability to become intangible are ideal for slipping in and out of places unnoticed. However, these traits also make it vulnerable to accidental interdimensional travel. It plays well with the other Monsters, but just like a cat, it sometimes prefers to be alone... or in the company of others of its kind.

EM_path1=Soggy Stones Path
EM_path1_bio=These stones are soaked! Maybe some thirsty monster created a mess while taking a drink here?

EM_path2=Dripping Pebbles Path
EM_path2_bio=These pebbles are still quite wet! Maybe some seaborne creature exited the water here?

EM_path3=Glistening Grass #1

EM_path6=Sapling Shavings
EM_path6_bio=These shavings off a Bihrrc tree have been left here for a while. Sources suggest they were carved by a fledgeling Stoopa working on her first mortar!

EM_path7=Overgrown Bubblerite Path
EM_path7_bio=Over the long span of time since this path was last taken care of, the moss has grown all over, to the point where it’s hard to tell what color it ever originally was.

Decoration/Decoration_test=Kee-Tree
Decoration/Decoration_test_bio=The Kee-Tree is a wooden amalgamation of wood and whimsy! While unable to play itself like the ancient Bass Machine, prophecies say that if played just right by the wind, the Kee-Tree can reveal a song not heard since the dawn of reality…
Decoration/Decoration_test1=Talkie Radish
Decoration/Decoration_test1_bio=Talkie Radishes are capable of remembering and saying out loud whatever a monster said while around it, so be careful to not reveal any special secrets you have while being around these gossipy plants or else eveyone will soon know everything about you.
Decoration/Decoration_test2=Saptree
Decoration/Decoration_test2_bio=These elegant trees are covered in sap, but who did that? Well the answer is simple: themselves! Saptrees have the ability of creating sap directly from their leaves, said sap is know for trapping little crriters who would dare to eat their greeny wig. Other monsters use the sap from the Saptree to extract sugar to make their delicious treats and even put in a big plate of pancakes!
Decoration/Decoration_test3=Souxls Tree
Decoration/Decoration_test3_bio=Souxls Tree bio

Decoration/Decoration_test5_bio=Funny Flora bio
Decoration/Decoration_test6=Juggle Tulip
Decoration/Decoration_test6_bio=At first glance, this can be easily mistaken for a Monster. But it's just a plant that can juggle anything, mostly eyeballs.
Decoration/Decoration_test7=Bucket-o-Cattail
Decoration/Decoration_test7_bio=Looks like someone plucked some Cattails from the Evergreen Marsh and put them in a bucket of water to keep them alive! Neat-o!
Decoration/Decoration_test8=Capsize Berry Tree
Decoration/Decoration_test8_bio=Capsize Berry Trees are well-loved throughout the lost landscapes for their delicious berries. They're so delicious in fact, monsters don't often realize the magical side-effect of the berries, where they float up into the air and fall down right on their heads!
Decoration/Decoration_test9=Spare Parts
Decoration/Decoration_test9_bio=It's a jar of spare parts! What's it for? Who knows? Are they spare parts for Blipsqueak? Are they spare parts for Handmond just in case its organs fail? Are they even spare parts at all!?
Decoration/Decoration_test10=Baloony
Decoration/Decoration_test10_bio=They call him friend substitute. Lonely monsters come to Baloony at any time and share their stories with him. Our "friend" used to fly around freely, exploring the monster world, but he got stuck between two rocks with nothing left to do but to sway serenely from side to side. Nobody knows who created Baloony, but rumors say that it slightly resembles its creation. Who knows, maybe we will meet one day.
Decoration/Decoration_test11=Blood Blossom Tree
Decoration/Decoration_test11_bio=Okay... I've seen a lot of disgusting things from the Terra of Organs but this takes the cake! Like what on Galvana's Monster World is that!? It's just- HMMPH! I gotta go to the bathroom... I think I'm gonna throw up...
Decoration/Decoration_test12=The King
Decoration/Decoration_test12_bio=Nobody knows what "The King" is, but everyone collectively agrees that they should stay away from it. It elicits heebee-jeebees to anyone brave enough to look at it in the eye.

Decoration/Decoration_knott=Mount Knottshurr
Decoration/Decoration_knott_bio=Fashioned in the likeness of the mythical Mountain Morsel, Mount Knottshurr is made up of Bubblerite shavings held together with slobber paste. Despite its artificial origin, it seems to have taken on a life of its own. What else could you expect in the magical Monster World?
Decoration/Decoration_mors=Mountain Morsel
Decoration/Decoration_mors_bio=This relic isn't from around these parts. After a few experimental licks, it was discovered it tastes like grape bubblegum. The visages carved into its surface occasionally emit a low hum when monsters aren't looking.

Not many relish the change given upon themselves by the bewitched place that is the Evergreen marsh, so be careful, and step lightly, for in the heart of the marsh one’s future is murkier than the swamp water, and cloudier than the emerald dome seen above the wigged top…

Monsters/VOIDCORN=<color="red">V O I D C O R N</color>
str_class_YOOL=<YOURMISSINGYOOL>

Monsters/Monster_olga=Olgaropipe
Monsters/Monster_olga_bio=Sent into the chronic void, Hyddryd's aquatic element overwhelmed all matter and reformed monsters into new identites, creating new monsters like the kind and soft Olgaropipe. Transformed, they now shimmered with luminescence, gaining the ability to manipulate water. United, they became protectors of the void, their movements echoing cosmic tides. Through liquid currents, they coordinate a mesmerizing symphony, bringing newfound equilibrium to the Gamma Water Island and the ruins of the Monster World.
Monsters/Monster_potbellyGM=Kelpebbul
Monsters/Monster_potbellyGM_bio=After the strange events that led to the ruins of the monster world being transferred to a realm outside of space and time, the islands we know and love were turned into Gamma Islands, their inhabitants reborn into spectacular new forms. One such example is the Kelpebbul, the reformed plant elemental, who dazzles with a dreamy demeanor and charms with the sweetest of smiles. These stone monsters have the power to imbue lifeforce into any plant, rejuvinating flora of all sorts and giving them means to vocalize. These sprouts tend to have strange and unique voices, a result of discovering their singing abilities the first time. 
Monsters/Monster_quibbleGM=Jastanaw
Monsters/Monster_quibbleGM_bio=Well... it seems that it's in a Quibble's DNA to denature into a strange creature whenever it's modified. Alike to monsters long since extinct such as the Epic and Prismatic Quibbles, it seems something in this monsters elemental core caused it to turn into... this. Worry not, because it doesn't seem like too painful of a condition, and it still loves to sing- or is that a scream? It's not a scream. We think.

Monsters/Bonapetite_bio=Some musicians tickle the ivories, but the Bona-Petite prefers tickling the ribs. Or perhaps 'having its ribs tickled' is more accurate, depending on which of these two percussionists we're talking about here. Truth is, each is symbiotically connected to the other and equally responsible for delivering punchy kick patterns peppered with a little bottom-end bulk. The duo consists of two monsters, amiably dubbed 'Bona' and 'Petite' by their Wublin pals. The smaller Petite puts the 'riff' in 'midriff,' while the larger Bona grumbles endlessly about indigestion.
Monsters/Congle_bio=2112-09-04
Monsters/Gnarls_bio=Depending on how you look at it, Gnarls are both bigger and smaller than any of the other Quint-Element Monsters. Bigger in the sense that each 'being' is actually comprised of multiple organisms instead of just one; and smaller because the Gnarls themselves are actually quite minuscule! Some might say they are little more than parasitic vines that attach themselves to a tree and coordinate to hijack the plant's latent motor functions. Then it's a simple matter of working together to 'animate' the tree's trunk and branches to give it a full range of motion. Each Gnarl operates the opposite side of the tree, and synchronously conjoin their tendrils to form a 'mouth' through which wind can blow to produce sound. Mercifully, the tree doesn't perceive this transformation as troublesome - instead, it delights in the opportunity to explore the Monster World and make music! Another mercy is that the Plant Top Boss's dual intelligences are satisfied to stick to one tree - no need to 'infect' anyone else.
Monsters/Krillby_bio=It is unclear whether Krillby's vestigial wings are powerful enough for sustained flight, but this Fire Monster is more at home on the ground than in the air. Its talons make it easy to maneuver across many different terrains, while its wings guide the air in and around the ocarina-like bodies to help produce the lovely whistles for which they are known. This also regulates the Krillby's body temperature when running very fast, something you have to do often when you look as tasty as Krillby does.
Monsters/Pladdie_bio=Gather 'round, wee laddies and lassies, and hear the distinct bellow of Pladdie: lord of the Faeries! A spinner of yarns and teller of tales, this tartan talent provides its own dramatic mood music to every storytelling experience. Whether they be legends of mysterious winged Monsters flapping in the night, or a titanic sea creature patrolling the deep, Pladdie is a pro at captivating its audience through song and speech.
Monsters/Buzzinga_bio=All Mythicals have something in common - their very existence has been questioned and doubted throughout Monster World history. The Buzzinga is one such example, whose constant flitting about the various dimensions of the multiverse make it feel like little more than myth. However, it has a pretty good excuse: this Monster acts as a pollinator for the flowers of the Stablo Mjehurica World Tree! Tapping into its family's ability to open supersonic interdimensional highways, it collects the tree's nectar and contributes to the formation of whole new realities. When it's interested in settling down for a while, the Buzzinga finds respite in the scorching heat of the remains of the living core where this universe has its beginning all those eons ago.
Monsters/Shlep_bio=For being such a wholesome-looking Monster itself, the Oasis Mythical must surely have some unusual dreams sometimes! That's the only reasonable explanation for the shLep, drawn from an extravagant imagination and brought into being in the dreamspace. Maybe it's a warped manifestation of a Blubberfly, incited by erstwhile desires for a little personal time? Some have proposed that the shLep is inspired by a memorable but noisy encounter with a denizen of the eclectically-populated coral reefs of the living ocean. For better or worse, this listless Dreamythical is now a permanent companion on Mythical Island, so best try to get along!
Monsters/Scaratar_bio=No longer forced to lay its trademark instrument on the ground, the Scaratar fastidiously infuses wood with special toxins that transform it into a more ornate version. At this age, the Celestial of Poison is perhaps a little too preoccupied with superficially being an indicator of quality, and will often fixate on polishing its instrument rather than practicing its arpeggios.
Monsters/Loodvigg_bio=Perhaps it's motivated by some sense of latent rebelliousness, or maybe it was just time for a change, but the adult Loodvigg has embraced the exact opposite of Shadow - Light! It grafts gleaming gems onto the teeth of its keyboard, coiffs its hair, cuffs and ruff, and prioritizes flashy and flamboyant flourishes in its musical performance.
Monsters/Uuduk_bio=For each year of life, the Uuduk gains an extra vertebra in its slinky spine. The full height of an Uuduk, however, is hidden from view deep beneath the soil: an Uuduk never reveals its age! Wear-and-tear on its impressive blowhorns may hint at the number of birthdays this coy Monster has seen, but it just as easily could indicate how itchy it was that day.
Monsters/Whimmzies_bio=Wimmzies are a bubbly chorus of Monsters positively bursting at the seams with delight. It's this very overflowing of glee that is cause for the sorority of singers' patchwork appearance: their delicately-sewn casings contain the fine mist that makes up the Wimmzie's upper bodies! Little more than fluttering eyelashes and tapping toes, this squad is nonetheless erupting with joy and - of course - whimsy.

#DEMENTED ISLAND#

Monsters/Monster_cataliszt=Cataliszt
Monsters/Monster_cataliszt_bio=The cat who play strings, yet lives a thing as a normal monster, It's haunting melody makes chills go down your spine. But, I wonder, If this island is unknown among all the islands that has been created by the creator, Why did he make this? Why did Catalyzt existed in this island? Among all of those <ERROR_DEMENTED_DREAM_MONSTERS>, Catalyzt is the only one who is normal. Is it me who is experiencing this? Or is it you.
